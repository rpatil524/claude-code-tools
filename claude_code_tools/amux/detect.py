"""Screen-scraping heuristics: what harness is this, and what is it doing.

Everything here is deliberately pure (string in, verdict out) so it can be
unit-tested against captured fixtures without a live tmux server.

Why screen-scraping at all: ``pane_current_command`` is useless for
identifying these harnesses -- Claude Code reports a bare version string like
``2.1.220`` because it runs a versioned binary, and Codex reports ``node``.
Process *argv* identifies the harness reliably; the *screen* is the only place
that reveals what it is currently doing.
